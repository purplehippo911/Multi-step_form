### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.


### Useful resources

- [Blog article about how to make a circle in CSS](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-border-radius-circle) - This helped me with making a perfectly round circle.

- [Mozilla DOCs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas) - This is an amazing article which helped me to recall how to use `grid-template-areas` and `grid-areas` for aligning multiple elements in Grid. I'd recommend this website to anyone  that needs help understanding things and concepts in CSS, JavaScript and HTML.
- [Vue Router Docs](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/#router-view) - This is an amazing article which helped me to recall how to use Vue Router correctly to route to different views in my app.
- [Take control of background images by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k) - This is a amazing video which helped me to understand how to use `background-image`'s correctly without the picture being cropped to much and how to make the images look better.
